> Note that you can `easily export an external C function` from your Cython module by declaring it as `cpdef`. `This generates a Python wrapper for it and adds it to the module dict`. Here is a Cython module that provides direct access to the C sin() function for Python code:
> ```Cython
> cdef extern from "math.h":
>     cpdef double sin(double x)
> ```
> You get the same result when this declaration appears in the `.pxd` file that **belongs to the Cython module (i.e. that has the same name**, see Sharing Declarations Between Cython Modules). This allows the C declaration to be reused in other Cython modules, while still providing an **automatically generated Python wrapper** in this specific module.
> 
> Note External declarations must be placed in a `.pxd` file in Pure Python mode.
